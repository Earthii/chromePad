# [ChromePad](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromepad/dpofibmpjiejdbmpkflaedamfkglbdfl)

chromePad is a chrome extension which enables users to take notes through chrome.

Notes are synced to your chrome storage. This means that if you are logged into chrome, your notes

will be syned across all your chrome browsers.

People are no longer required to open up a word file, a text file, etc to take simple notes.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

`npm run build` will build the prod artifacts.
